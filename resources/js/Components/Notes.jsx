                   I'm very grateful to all of you who use this website, I hope this website, although
                   it's just a web for my test in second semester, can be helpful or even you're having
                   a great time to use it. <br /><br />
                   This website is so simple that i failed the last test because of to simple design
                   and having some problem and unused route for a merely simple website. I redesigned
                   it, and I hope this design is better than before. If you have some words for my
                   project, I really, really appreciate it. With love, REN
